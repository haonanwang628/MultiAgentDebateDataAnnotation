The justification aligns because the text explicitly narrows quality's scope to these two domains, mirroring the QA Engineer's role in defining precise metrics. The emphasis on \"purpose of a definition\" [L 1] further supports the code's focus on scoped quality standards, distinct from broader interpretations.]\n\n🔵 Negative   Round 1:\n[The target text broadly mentions \"quality\" at \"process level and software level\" [L 1-2], not narrowly scoped definitions.
