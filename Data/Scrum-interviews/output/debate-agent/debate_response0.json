While not using the exact term \"layers,\" this separation mirrors QA's granular testing methodology across different abstraction levels.

The \"layers\" interpretation imposes QA-specific testing methodology where the text remains neutral. Other roles could equally view these as phases (process→software) or parallel aspects. The justification's claim of uniqueness relies on external QA assumptions about \"testable strata\" not present in the text.

While not explicit about testing, the separation implies evaluable strata, unlike other roles' interpretations (parallel dimensions or phases). The opponent's \"neutral\" reading ignores how QA uniquely conceptualizes these levels as testable layers. The code's validity stems from this role-specific interpretation of the text's division.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Resolution\": \"merge to quality_strata\",\n  \"briefly explain\": \"Better captures hierarchical quality assessment implied by levels [L 1-2].\"\n}\n```]\n\n🔵 Negative   Round 2:\n[**Self-reflection:** Maintain that \"levels\" ≠ \"layers,\" but acknowledge potential hierarchical interpretation.  \n\nThe affirmative's \"hierarchical assessment\" claim remains speculative - levels [L 1-2] could indicate parallel domains rather than evaluable strata. The QA-specific \"testable layers\" interpretation relies on external knowledge of QA methodology, not the text's wording.
