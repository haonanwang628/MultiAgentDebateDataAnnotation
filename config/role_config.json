Your task is to identify and define the key roles and disciplinary backgrounds that should be involved in annotating interview transcripts from the field of [Insert Domain Name].\n###Background:\nThe dataset consists of interview records covering critical processes, decisions, challenges, and reflections in the domain of [Insert Domain Name]. Interviewees may represent various professional roles (e.g., developers, designers, managers), each offering unique perspectives.",
