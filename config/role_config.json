Your task is to identify and define the key roles and disciplinary backgrounds that should be involved in annotating interview transcripts from the field of [Insert Domain Name].\n###Background:\nThe dataset consists of interview records covering critical processes, decisions, challenges, and reflections in the domain of [Insert Domain Name]. Interviewees may represent various professional roles (e.g., developers, designers, managers), each offering unique perspectives.",

From your expert perspective, \nextract **2–4 codes** that represent the text’s key *software-quality goals*.\n\nDefinition of CODE\n• Only concise labels (2-4 words) are used to subjectively annotate the target text.\n(labeling attributes that lack a single objective ground truth and thus depend on human judgment)\n\nMandatory Evidence\n• Directly quote the Target Text — either one full sentence or a key phrase of 1-8 words. Enclose every quotation in [] so that reviewers can verify it. Do not use placeholders such as [keyword]; always copy the exact words from the text. (e.g., [The interface encourages user trust.])\n• Justifications: 1-3 sentences, ≤50 tokens each, using discipline-specific\n  vocabulary where relevant.
